# Weekly on-call rotation
#
# This script will print out the starting date you are on-call for a year. The
# assumption is, each rotation is for a full week (Monday - Monday).
#
# To set your rotation schedule put a date you were once on-call for
# "my_oncall_date". Adjust the rotation size with "users" variable. This
# includes yourself.
